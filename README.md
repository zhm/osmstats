# OSM Stats

This is just a little experiment with d3js and the OpenStreetMap Overpass API.
I've been wanting some better editing statistics for OSM so I thought I'd see
what's possible with the Overpass API. It fetches all edits for a user and
determines which tags are used the most. It also finds all of the related tags for
each tag and has an interactive force-based canvas displaying the links between
the tags.
